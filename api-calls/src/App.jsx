/* 1. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples?
- Any code that affects an outside system.
- local storage, API, web sockets, two states to keep in sync


2. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples?
- Anything that React is in charge of.
- Maintaining state, keeping the UI in sync with the data, 
  render DOM elements


3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?
- As soon as the component loads (first render)
- On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array)
- Will NOT run the effect when the values of the dependencies in the
  array stay the same between renders


4. How would you explain what the "dependecies array" is?
- Second parameter to the useEffect function
- A way for React to know whether it should re-run the effect function
